# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification-with-Keras
This project explores the use of transfer learning with the VGG16 model to enhance image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency were achieved compared to training a model from scratch.
