# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification-with-Keras
Overview:
This project investigates the application of transfer learning for image classification using Keras, focusing on fine-tuning a pre-trained model to achieve high performance on a specific dataset.

Objective:
The primary goal is to utilize transfer learning to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image classification, by selecting a suitable dataset and evaluating the performance of the adapted model.

Process:
1. Dataset Selection: The CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for image classification tasks.
2. Pre-Trained Model: The VGG16 model, originally designed for large-scale image classification, was selected for transfer learning.
3. Data Preprocessing: The CIFAR-10 dataset was loaded and preprocessed, including normalization and data augmentation techniques.
4. Model Adaptation: 
    - Layer Freezing: The initial layers of the VGG16 model were frozen to retain the learned features from the original training.
    - Layer Unfreezing: The latter layers were fine-tuned to adapt the model to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
5. Training: The adapted model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
6. Evaluation: 
    - The performance of the transfer learning model was compared to a baseline model trained from scratch.
    - Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. Results Analysis: 
    - The transfer learning approach demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy and reduced training time.
    - The VGG16 model successfully generalized to the new dataset after fine-tuning.

Findings:
This project illustrates that transfer learning with the VGG16 model substantially enhances the accuracy and efficiency of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Fine-tuning enabled the model to adapt effectively to the new task, outperforming a model that was trained from scratch.
